# KVM-Based Hypervisor Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a custom hypervisor built from scratch using KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). The hypervisor is responsible for managing virtual machines (VMs), including tasks such as virtual machine creation, memory allocation, and vCPU execution. The project also includes the engineering of hardware-assisted hypercalls to facilitate various functionalities like data printing and translating guest virtual addresses to host virtual addresses.

## Features

- **KVM-Based Hypervisor:**
  - Developed a hypervisor using KVM, managing virtual machine lifecycle, including creation, memory allocation, and vCPU execution.
  - Ensured efficient resource utilization and optimized performance.

- **Hardware-Assisted Hypercalls:**
  - Implemented hypercalls to support critical functionalities such as:
    - **Data Printing:** Allows the guest VM to print data via the host.
    - **Address Translation:** Translates guest virtual addresses to host virtual addresses, enhancing memory management and debugging.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux (with KVM support enabled).
- **Kernel Version:** Linux Kernel 5.x or later recommended.
- **Tools & Libraries:**
  - GCC for compiling the hypervisor.
  - QEMU (optional) for testing and interacting with the virtual machines.
  - Libvirt (optional) for managing VMs via a higher-level interface.
